        Approach: Sort the array. Have a set of list of integers (threeSumSet), to store three sum cobos.
                  Go through each item (i). For each item, have two pointers: one pointing to the next item (j), and another
                  one pointing to the end of the array (k). Now, do a 2-way-sweep. While j and k doesn't meet, at each step
                  calculate sum = (nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]).
                  [Starting sweep from next item to prevent duplicate combos because of indexes like ( [i,j,k], [j,i,k]).]
                  If sum == 0, we found a three-sum combo! Add it to the threeSumSet. If there is any
                  duplicate combo because of different indexes but same items like 
                  ([i1, j1, k1], [i2, j2, k2], but i1==i2, j1==j2, k1==k2). This will automatically be taken care of by the 
                  set, as it analyzes the added Lists and makes sure there is no duplicate.                   
                  If sum > 0, we should try decreasing the sum value. So we'll decrement k, as this should potentially
                  result nums[k] being smaller than previous value, as the array is sorted.
                  If sum < 0, because of the same reason, we'll increment j.
                  Finally, we'll convert the threeSumSet to ArrayList and return.
